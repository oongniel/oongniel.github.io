                            <p>IMS will help applicants look for the job that would have the best fit to their qualifications and credentials.</p>
                            <p>Send your resume through email imsphil305@gmail.com if you believe that you are qualified for any of the job openings or if you want to explore opportunities abroad. Indicate which job you are applying to and your availability for an interview schedule. Upon submission, your resume will instantly included in our databank and will be subjected to IMS review.</p>
                            <p><strong>As a qualified candidate, what is the process of recruiting a candidate of my recruitment and processing at IMS?</strong></p>
                            <p>Upon sending your resume to IMS, we will immediately review your qualifications and credentials vis a vis the current job options in your selected industry. See below for a step by step process on how IMS screens and recruits qualified candidates:</p>
                            <p>IMS reviews the current manpower pool in the database. If IMS sees applicants who are qualified for the job description, they will be contacted for an initial interview and pre-screening. Short-listed applicants will be contacted again by IMS for an interview with the employer. Applicants who are chosen will be tendered an Employment Offer.</p>
                            <p>Chosen candidate would have to: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Undergo a medical exam</li>
                                <li>Submit documents for visa, POEA, exit permit and OWWA</li>
                                <li>Pre-Departure Orientation and will be given Deployment Assistance</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Chosen candidate will be placed at the designated worksite and will thus be ready to start their career</p>
                            <p><strong>Will IMS charge me placement fees, salary deductions, or other fees at any point during my application, screening, and job placement?</strong></p>
                            <p>When an applicant applies at IMS, the company does NOT charge the applicant any placement, processing or hidden fees.</p>
                            <p><strong>What is the period of my employment with the company if I am hired?</strong></p>
                            <p>Depending on the nature of the job entailed, our principals generally hire on a contractual basis with jobs that give them an option to renew their contracts with the company. Thus, employment with the principal is on a case to case basis -- some renewable, some within a specific timeframe, and others on an indefinite period. </p>
                            <p>Rest assured, IMS coordinates with overseas principals who can provide long, fulfilling and promising careers to Filipino employees. In fact, we have deployed numerous Filipinos who have been retained by our principals for more than 30 years.</p>
                            <p><strong>I reported to IMS and went through the preliminary screening, but I was not called back for short-listing. May I still apply again at IMS?</strong></p>
                            <p>Absolutely! The ever growing requirements of our principals open doors for different job positions that require different qualifications and credentials. Since we have several ongoing projects, our principals will need different types of employees. If an applicant is not short-listed in one job opening, he may be qualified for the next. For this reason, we never close our doors to people who want to apply at IMS. In fact, we pride ourselves in trying to fit the qualifications of an applicant to the job requirements of the principal.</p> 
                            <p><strong>I have been interviewed and I am one of the short-listed candidates. How and when do I get the results? </strong></p>
                            <p>Patience is a virtue. Each of our clients have their own criteria and timeline as to when to select the candidate that they want to deploy. IMS believes in giving feedback to their applicants and rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the information is available. </p>
                            <p><strong>What are the important preliminary requirements if I am fully determined to work overseas?</strong></p>
                            <p>RESUME WITH DETAILED JOB DESCRIPTION AND PHOTO <br>
                            NBI CLEARANCE <br>
                            PASSPORT - Make sure it is valid for at least two (2) years <br>
                            COLLEGE DIPLOMA & TOR – Make sure that is  authenticated by the CHED</p>
                            <p><strong>What is the monthly salary rate when I get employed?  </strong></p>
                            <p>As with most job types, the salary rate for a position is commensurate to the applicant’s qualification and experience. This rate is not discussed during the final interview since only technical data and questions are asked by the company's representative. However, the compensation package is formalized into an Offer of Employment with accompanying employee benefits and other terms and conditions of the Employment Contract after the candidate selection. </p>
                            <p>Rest assured, IMS only deals with the best and reputable clients – those who can provide our applicants a highly competitive compensation and benefits packages.</p>
                            <p><strong>How will I know that the recruitment agency / placement firm I choose to deal with is legitimate?   </strong></p>
                            <p>The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) publishes a list of licensed Philippine recruitment and placement agencies. We are proud to say that IMS has always been part of this published list of POEA. Because we would like to be in service to the Filipino, we have a proven track record for practicing business ethics. Our name is our bond.</p>
